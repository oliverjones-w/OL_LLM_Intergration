According to an its website, Quantedge employs a systematic quantitative investment strategy, diversified across various asset classes, including equities, bonds, commodities, currencies, and insurance-linked securities.  Mulvaney Global Markets Fund meanwhile, a systematic long-term trend-following programme, posted a 3.1% increase in September, marking its first profitable month in four months, with the fund’s biggest gains coiming from metals and interest rate positions.  Despite some recent struggles, Mulvaney surged 124% in the first quarter and is now up 72.66% for the year. The majority of its gains so far have been driven by soft commodities. The fund’s portfolio includes agricultural, energy, metal, and financial futures, focusing on markets such as metals, energy, crops, livestock, currencies, and interest rates.  The DUNN World Monetary & Agriculture Program saw a more modest 1.03% gain in September, breaking a five-month losing streak and lifting its year-to-date gain to 10.46%. A version of the same strategy with half the leverage gained 0.55% for the month, and is now up 6.06% for the year.  DUNN’s September gains were driven by fixed income, metals, currencies, and stocks, which more than offset moderate losses in agriculture, energy, and volatility.  Another September winner was the the Aspect Diversified Fund, which posted a 1% gain for the month, pushing year-to-date performance to 11.6%, with the fund benefitting from long fixed-income positions, driven by interest rate cuts. The weaker US dollar also boosted performance, particularly through its short dollar exposure, although performance in stock indices proved challenging.  Not all funds enjoyed a positive month, however, with the Tulip Trend Fund seeing a 2.3% loss in September, reducing its year-to-date gain to 1.8%.

The report cites regulatory filings as showing that the combined stake of Citadel’s principals and staff in the Wellington fund rose to 20% by the end of 2023, up from 12% in 2019. In dollar terms, their investment has more than tripled to around $9bn during this period, including the holdings of Citadel’s founder, Ken Griffin.  The growth highlights how Citadel is balancing rewarding its team and retaining top talent during a period of stellar investment performance. Wellington, Citadel’s largest fund, delivered annualised returns of 25.9%, resulting in higher payouts for portfolio managers, who are required to leave about half of their incentive bonuses locked in the fund for three and a half years.  Ed O’Reilly, head of Citadel’s client and partner group, said: “Our employees have invested in our funds for over 30 years. The alignment of interests with our external capital partners underscores our commitment to building a lasting franchise.”  However, there is a downside to Citadel’s success for investors in so far as some of the firms funds can only handle a certain amount of capital before performance starts to wane, meaning that for decades, the firm has returned profits to investors annually, including $6bn from Wellington in 2023 alone, leaving the fund with $44.8bn at the start of this year. In contrast, employees’ deferred compensation remains invested until their lockups expire, giving them an advantage as the fund grows.  In addition to deferred compensation, Citadel allows principals to make voluntary investments in its funds. Over the past five years, assets in two of these vehicles, CEIF and CEIF Partners, have doubled to about $5bn. Employees pay the same fees on their invested cash as external clients.  Griffin, 56, remains the largest individual investor in Wellington, with his stake in Citadel Advisors and its funds accounting for almost half of his $41.8bn fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  The growing employee stake in Citadel’s funds reflects a broader shift in its capital base. Over the years, the firm has replaced money from funds of funds with capital from institutional investors, such as charities and universities. By the end of 2021, institutional cash peaked at 60% of Citadel’s net assets, up from 41% five years earlier, while funds of funds dropped from 32% to 9%.  Since then, employees have become the fastest-growing segment of Citadel’s investor base, rising to 29% of total assets by mid-2023, compared to 21% at the end of 2021. Meanwhile, institutions now account for 54% of overall assets, down from their peak but with their holdings still growing in value as Citadel’s net assets surged to $64bn.  The increase in deferred compensation also makes it more difficult—and expensive—for competitors to lure Citadel’s traders and portfolio managers, with recruiters often having to compensate new hires for deferred pay they leave behind when switching firms.

The report cites an unnamed investor source as also confirming that the firm’s long-only Loan Cascade fund saw an 8% rise for the quarter and is now up 25% for the year.  The gains have helped the fund recoup earlier losses, including Q4 2021 declines of 12% and 10% at Lone Cypress and Lone Cascades, respectively, coupled with annual losses the following year of 36% and 42% amid a broader bear market.  Both funds rebounded in 2023, with Lone Cypress up 19% and Lone Cascade surging 32%. Under the terms of the firm’s modified performance fee structure, Loan Pine can charge half of its performance fee even before fully recovering previous losses, but will only return to charging the full fee once it recovers 200% declines.  Currently managing about $17 billion—down from $31 billion at the end of 2020 — Lone Pine’s portfolio is heavily invested in major tech stocks and beneficiaries of artificial intelligence. As of the second quarter, its largest holding, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, accounted for about 8.5% of its assets, driven by the company’s close ties to AI chipmaker Nvidia, which Lone Pine does not own.  Other significant positions include Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms, making up 20% of the firm’s assets. Non-tech holdings among its top ten include tobacco giant Philip Morris, private equity firm KKR, and Vistra Corp, a leading electricity and power generation company that has performed well this year.

The report cites an unnamed investor source as also confirming that the firm’s long-only Loan Cascade fund saw an 8% rise for the quarter and is now up 25% for the year.  The gains have helped the fund recoup earlier losses, including Q4 2021 declines of 12% and 10% at Lone Cypress and Lone Cascades, respectively, coupled with annual losses the following year of 36% and 42% amid a broader bear market.  Both funds rebounded in 2023, with Lone Cypress up 19% and Lone Cascade surging 32%. Under the terms of the firm’s modified performance fee structure, Loan Pine can charge half of its performance fee even before fully recovering previous losses, but will only return to charging the full fee once it recovers 200% declines.  Currently managing about $17 billion—down from $31 billion at the end of 2020 — Lone Pine’s portfolio is heavily invested in major tech stocks and beneficiaries of artificial intelligence. As of the second quarter, its largest holding, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, accounted for about 8.5% of its assets, driven by the company’s close ties to AI chipmaker Nvidia, which Lone Pine does not own.  Other significant positions include Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms, making up 20% of the firm’s assets. Non-tech holdings among its top ten include tobacco giant Philip Morris, private equity firm KKR, and Vistra Corp, a leading electricity and power generation company that has performed well this year.

The fund is now trailing the S&P 500 by nearly 50% points so far this year, although the index is not its primary benchmark.  This year’s losses follow a challenging 2023, where Haidar posted a 43.4% drop. The fund has been in the red for 14 of the past 22 months, often with double-digit losses in stark contrast to its performance in 2022 when it surged by almost 193%, building on strong gains from prior years.  The October loss is not attributed to specific factors, though Haidar’s September report shows its leveraged positions were primarily in fixed income (38% of exposure), equities (24%), and commodities (18%). Year-to-date, fixed income and commodities have driven the bulk of losses, contributing 11.7% and 8.2% of the decline, respectively. Only equities have been profitable, adding nearly 6% to gains over the first nine months.  Haidar isn’t alone in facing a challenging year. Another macro hedge fund, BH Macro, reported a 2.91% drop in October, with its year-to-date gains now at just 0.11%. In contrast, Discovery Capital Management has seen strong performance, with its fund up 28.05% for the year, following a modest 0.97% gain in October.

The report cites the firm’s monthly report as revealing that October performance outpaced the broader market, as the S&P 500 saw a 0.9% loss last month taking its YTD gain to 21%. Third Point’s gains were largely driven by its fundamental and event-driven equity strategies, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, LPL Financial Holdings, and Siemens Energy, among the top performers. Life sciences firm Danaher Corp, Bath & Body Works, and Microsoft, meanwhile were among the biggest detractors.  For the full year, the fundamental and event-driven segment has contributed the most to Third Point’s gains, supplemented by 2.8% from credit and 2.5% from private investments. An undisclosed private position remains the fund’s top performer in 2024, followed by energy company Vistra Corp, which surged 220%, outperforming Nvidia.

The $12 billion Brevan Howard Master Fund gained 6.1% this month through Nov. 15, which will be its strongest performance since March 2020 if returns remain steady, according to documents seen by Bloomberg News. That works out to an estimate of roughly $700 million after fees, according to Bloomberg calculations. Much of the gains have come from bets on foreign exchange, including wagers that the euro would fall against the US dollar, US stocks and volatility trades, people familiar with the matter said.  The euro has tumbled to its lowest against the greenback in more than a year since Trump was elected earlier this month while US stocks hit a record high, part of a rally that generated massive gains for some investors. Rokos Capital Management, the hedge fund started by former Brevan Howard trader and co-founder Chris Rokos, made almost $1 billion on the day after the vote, Bloomberg News has reported.  A spokesperson for Brevan Howard declined to comment.  The gains may help Jersey, Channel Islands-based Brevan Howard turn around its performance after a muted period. The flagship Master Fund returned just 0.1% for the year through October, compared with a 5.8% increase for the Bloomberg Macro Hedge Fund Index, the documents show. The Master Fund had one of its worst months on record in February, losing about 3% after bets on US interest rates backfired, Bloomberg News reported at the time. In the months that followed, the firm fired 10% of its traders and shuttered funds run by star managers Alfredo Saitta and Louis Basger. Saitta has since left the company. Brevan Howard is one of the world’s most vaunted so-called macro hedge funds that try to profit from bets on interest rates and currencies. Howard helped to found the firm after leaving Credit Suisse in the early 2000s and the Master Fund has since made more than $19 billion of profit, Bloomberg News reported earlier this year.

His main Andurand Commodities Discretionary Enhanced Fund, which is run with no set risk limits, jumped 23% in November to erase losses seen this year through October, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The separate Andurand Commodities Discretionary Fund rose 13.5% last month, said the the person, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. The Enhanced fund is now up 13.8% this year, after being down 7.6% through October, according to the person and an investor letter seen by Bloomberg. The Discretionary fund has gained 9.3%, rebounding from a 3.7% loss recorded in the first 10 months.  A representative for Andurand Capital Management, which managed about $900 million by the end of October, declined to comment. Wild swings at Andurand’s hedge funds aren’t uncommon, and separate the famed oil trader from his bigger peers who’ve transitioned into producing steadier returns. This year alone, his main hedge fund has suffered double-digit monthly losses twice while also enjoying returns of more than 20% on three occasions, the investor letter shows. Below are monthly percentage performances for the Andurand Commodities Discretionary Enhanced Fund this year: *T ================================================================ Jan. |Feb.  |March |April |May |June |July|Aug.|Sept.|Oct. |Nov. ================================================================ 2.1| 1| 21.9| 30.2|-0.2|-22.1|-6.9|-0.4| -5.9|-16.9|23.2 *T It’s not clear what drove the performance last month, but Andurand told clients going into November that he was bullish on cocoa and copper. He also said he planned to be nimble and tactical on oil trades that Andurand revived after quitting the commodity a few months earlier. “Our conviction is high that cocoa prices will continue their upward trajectory and could be explosive,” Andurand wrote to clients in his letter for October, a copy of which was seen by Bloomberg.  The energy market veteran was lured into cocoa by a huge global supply crunch caused by poor harvests in West Africa that sent prices soaring to a record in April. Futures rallied 37% in November in New York, with renewed crop worries and US port stockpiles at a two-decade low making cocoa one of this year’s hottest commodities. Andurand also said that the firm was modestly positioned long on oil via futures and options, and planned to trade actively around any changes to OPEC+ policy or geopolitical events. Oil prices were little changed in November, with benchmark Brent futures ending the month down 0.3%. Crude briefly flared on concerns that escalating conflict in the Middle East could disrupt exports from the region, before easing as hopes for a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah returned traders’ focus to faltering demand growth in China and plentiful supply from the Americas. Meanwhile, Andurand’s bullish copper bets — which led to over half of his fund’s losses in October — may have continued to suffer. The metal slid the most in 18 months in November as the dollar surged following Donald Trump’s US election victory. A stronger greenback erodes the purchasing power for manufacturers buying copper using other currencies, while Trump’s threats over a trade war with China have hurt the outlook for demand.

Citadel’s commodities business generated about $4 billion of profit this year, driven by natural gas trading, according to people familiar with the matter. That puts it on track to rival last year’s performance. The firm’s flagship Wellington fund gained about 13.2% this year through November. A spokesperson for Citadel, which managed $65 billion as of Nov. 1, said the firm doesn’t comment on its performance. Trading profits, particularly in energy, have been muted across the industry as an extended period of volatility following the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has begun to subside. The slowdown is taking a toll on firms such as Glencore Plc and Gunvor Group, as well as hedge fund boss Pierre Andurand, who ditched oil trades earlier this year for bets on copper and cocoa.     The profits at Citadel’s commodities unit extend its positive run. It generated more than $4 billion last year and roughly double that amount in 2022. The crude and fuel trading business has encountered some challenges this year, with the departure of portfolio manager and fuel trader Drew Beaver as that Houston-based team’s performance faltered. But strong gains in natural gas trading in Europe and North America ended up boosting profits, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private results.  Citadel is uniquely positioned because of its merchant trading group, Citadel Energy Marketing. The unit, led by former Morgan Stanley commodities chief Jay Rubenstein, has been a key source of profits in recent years as it encompasses physical trading such as storage and transportation. The business also includes weather derivatives and modeling, which can be crucial tools for natural gas trading. Citadel’s success in navigating physical and financial commodities markets has prompted a flurry of competitors to follow suit.

His main Andurand Commodities Discretionary Enhanced Fund, which is run with no set risk limits, jumped 23% in November to erase losses seen this year through October, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The separate Andurand Commodities Discretionary Fund rose 13.5% last month, said the the person, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. The Enhanced fund is now up 13.8% this year, after being down 7.6% through October, according to the person and an investor letter seen by Bloomberg. The Discretionary fund has gained 9.3%, rebounding from a 3.7% loss recorded in the first 10 months.  A representative for Andurand Capital Management, which managed about $900 million by the end of October, declined to comment. Wild swings at Andurand’s hedge funds aren’t uncommon, and separate the famed oil trader from his bigger peers who’ve transitioned into producing steadier returns. This year alone, his main hedge fund has suffered double-digit monthly losses twice while also enjoying returns of more than 20% on three occasions, the investor letter shows. Below are monthly percentage performances for the Andurand Commodities Discretionary Enhanced Fund this year: *T ================================================================ Jan. |Feb.  |March |April |May |June |July|Aug.|Sept.|Oct. |Nov. ================================================================ 2.1| 1| 21.9| 30.2|-0.2|-22.1|-6.9|-0.4| -5.9|-16.9|23.2 *T It’s not clear what drove the performance last month, but Andurand told clients going into November that he was bullish on cocoa and copper. He also said he planned to be nimble and tactical on oil trades that Andurand revived after quitting the commodity a few months earlier. “Our conviction is high that cocoa prices will continue their upward trajectory and could be explosive,” Andurand wrote to clients in his letter for October, a copy of which was seen by Bloomberg.  The energy market veteran was lured into cocoa by a huge global supply crunch caused by poor harvests in West Africa that sent prices soaring to a record in April. Futures rallied 37% in November in New York, with renewed crop worries and US port stockpiles at a two-decade low making cocoa one of this year’s hottest commodities. Andurand also said that the firm was modestly positioned long on oil via futures and options, and planned to trade actively around any changes to OPEC+ policy or geopolitical events. Oil prices were little changed in November, with benchmark Brent futures ending the month down 0.3%. Crude briefly flared on concerns that escalating conflict in the Middle East could disrupt exports from the region, before easing as hopes for a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah returned traders’ focus to faltering demand growth in China and plentiful supply from the Americas. Meanwhile, Andurand’s bullish copper bets — which led to over half of his fund’s losses in October — may have continued to suffer. The metal slid the most in 18 months in November as the dollar surged following Donald Trump’s US election victory. A stronger greenback erodes the purchasing power for manufacturers buying copper using other currencies, while Trump’s threats over a trade war with China have hurt the outlook for demand.

Citadel’s commodities business generated about $4 billion of profit this year, driven by natural gas trading, according to people familiar with the matter. That puts it on track to rival last year’s performance. The firm’s flagship Wellington fund gained about 13.2% this year through November. A spokesperson for Citadel, which managed $65 billion as of Nov. 1, said the firm doesn’t comment on its performance. Trading profits, particularly in energy, have been muted across the industry as an extended period of volatility following the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has begun to subside. The slowdown is taking a toll on firms such as Glencore Plc and Gunvor Group, as well as hedge fund boss Pierre Andurand, who ditched oil trades earlier this year for bets on copper and cocoa.     The profits at Citadel’s commodities unit extend its positive run. It generated more than $4 billion last year and roughly double that amount in 2022. The crude and fuel trading business has encountered some challenges this year, with the departure of portfolio manager and fuel trader Drew Beaver as that Houston-based team’s performance faltered. But strong gains in natural gas trading in Europe and North America ended up boosting profits, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private results.  Citadel is uniquely positioned because of its merchant trading group, Citadel Energy Marketing. The unit, led by former Morgan Stanley commodities chief Jay Rubenstein, has been a key source of profits in recent years as it encompasses physical trading such as storage and transportation. The business also includes weather derivatives and modeling, which can be crucial tools for natural gas trading. Citadel’s success in navigating physical and financial commodities markets has prompted a flurry of competitors to follow suit. Balyasny Asset Management and Jain Global are among the firms building physical businesses to boost trading profits.

These are from the summer but lets make sure we have them.     https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2digpbapfzh5m8j5huscg/hedge-funds/the-outperforming-macro-funds-ones-that-nailed-interest-rate-forecasting     Macro hedge funds posted a wide range of returns in the first half of the year, with several strategies up by double-digit rates and others in the red or up by low single digits.  A big factor in performance was the funds’ positioning for interest rates. Managers that expected the Federal Reserve to begin reducing interest rates were hurt when the central bank failed to lower targets because of stubborn inflation levels, particularly in the second quarter.     Meanwhile, the bond market has generally been more volatile over the past 18 months than during the previous ten years. Graham Capital Management’s Ken Tropin pointed out that from 2010 to 2021 three global central banks instituted a total of just 13 rate changes of 25 basis points each. In the past 18 months, the same banks have made 60 rate changes of 25 basis points each, sharply increasing the opportunity set for macro managers. “It is more constructive for macro when rates are moving a lot,” Tropin stressed in a recent phone interview. “It also has a knock-on effect on equities and foreign exchange.”  One of the top performers in the first half was Robert Citrone’s Discovery Capital Management, which was up 21.7 percent despite losing 1.2 percent in June. It rose 4.1 percent in the second quarter, according to the firm’s June monthly report, obtained by Institutional Investor. All asset classes contributed to increases in the first half, led by long exposure to sovereign debt and long and short equity positions, the report said. “Thematically, gains were driven by our EM macro exposure led by long exposure in LATAM [Latin America], India, and shorts in our China theme driven by currency shorts,” Citrone stated.  Altogether, Latin America accounted for roughly two-thirds of the fund’s climb during the six-month period. On the fundamental side, Discovery noted that gains were driven by short positions in financials and long positions in technology, media, and telecom, or TMT.     Elsewhere, Chris Rokos’s Rokos Capital Management was flat for the second straight month but remains up 20 percent for the year, according to someone who saw the results. Bridgewater Associates’ Pure Alpha fund rose 14.25 percent in the first half, says a person who viewed the results.  At Graham Capital Management, Graham Quant Macro fund, its largest quantitative offering, was up 1.04 percent in June and 12.5 percent for the year, revealed someone who saw the results. Returns were driven primarily by stocks, foreign exchange, and energy, according to the source.  Graham Absolute Return, the firm’s largest discretionary fund, was up 7.51 percent for the year after gaining 0.41 percent in June. The fund was helped by equities, long- and intermediate-term interest rates, foreign exchange, and credit, the source said.  The firm’s Proprietary Matrix fund, which is half quant and half discretionary, was up 11.03 percent in first-half 2024 after gaining 0.35 percent in June. It was driven by equities, rates, foreign exchange, and credit, the source added.  Looking forward, Graham. Capital’s favorite trade is a yield curve steepener, a bet that yields will decline on the short end at the same time that long rates either don’t go down or go even higher. The result will be a wider spread.  Other macro funds have not fared nearly as well.     Greg Coffey’s Kirkoswald Capital Partners was flat in June and up just 2 percent in the first half, according to two sources. Paul Tudor Jones II’s Tudor BVI Global Fund lost 80 basis points in June and finished the first half down 50 basis points, two sources said. Brevan Howard’s BH Macro fund was down 1.53 percent for the first half despite gaining 0.89 percent in June, according to the fund’s weekly report, seen by II. Losses were driven primarily by rates; digital assets were the best performer.  The biggest loser in the macro world was the Haidar Jupiter Fund, which dropped a further 3.2 percent in June, bringing its decline for the half of the year to 20.23 percent. Haidar’s losses also were primarily driven by rates.  “With U.S. economic data continuing to moderate, the likelihood that the Fed will cut interest rates in September appears to be rising,” Haidar predicted in its May monthly report. Heading into June, fixed income accounted for 32 percent of the fund’s exposure, equities 30 percent, and commodities 26 percent, according to the report.

How does Jane Street do it? The Financial Times  <https://www.ft.com/content/f7cb25ba-7329-4291-b7d3-8a34ef84f9f0> said in September that Jane Street is less of a pure technology driven market maker than firms like Citadel Securities and Jump Trading, and that it will sometimes hold positions for ""weeks and days"". Founded in 2000 Jane Street made its name trading ETFs, but has branched out is moving deeper into areas like government bond and currency trading.  <https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/quantitative-fixed-income-traders> This diversification seems to be working.     As it grows, Jane Street needs talent. It likes to hire people at the start of their careers and to train them up. The Indian student at IIT Madras reportedly interned at Jane Street in Hong Kong last summer and is now joining Jane Street full-time. His/her pay package is over twice as high as that offered to the next most highly paid IIT graduate, and four times higher than that offered to IIT students joining other niche trading firms.      It's not unusual for Jane Street to pay student hires generously: recently graduated engineers <https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/12/jane-street-entry-level-pay>  there get $325k. The $500k package for the IIT trader reportedly includes salary, bonus and relocation costs. The bigger Jane Street becomes, the more frequent this will be.  Separately, if you can't make a lot of money immediately after graduating by joining Jane Street, you can maybe build a company worth $500m+ after a brief spell at JPMorgan.     Stephen Hunter studied law at the University of Bristol in the UK before working as an analyst in JPMorgan's leveraged finance team in London for two years. Then he skipped to the buy side for fourteen months. Then he went free-range and set up his own company, 9Fin <https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2020/05/ex-jpmorgan-analyst-still-hiring-for-stealthy-fintech> . 9Fin sits at the zeitgeisty nexus of private credit and AI and 'uses artificial intelligence to automate the extraction and analysis of data relevant to bond pricing.'      The Financial Times  <https://www.ft.com/content/4897fc5c-374f-4423-b824-21b317e58c83?shareType=nongift> reports that 9Fin now has 250 employees and is worth in excess of $500m. It's just raised $50m in financing. Hunter is saying things like, ""There is at least a billion-dollar revenue business to be built in this space.” Maybe there are more lucrative things than Jane Street after all.     Meanwhile...

The Master fund, which has $12bn in assets under management, gained 6.87% in November, according to people familiar with the matter. The flagship fund is now up 6.95% year-to-date.  ADVERTISEMENT  Brevan Howard was co-founded by British hedge fund billionaire Alan Howard in 2002. The firm has $34bn in assets under management.  The Master fund’s 6.87% jump in November has topped its 5.1% surge in September which turned the $12bn fund positive for the year.  Brevan Howard’s Master fund struggled during the first eight months of the year as it lost almost 1.7% through August. However, winning macro trades and the share rally following Donald Trump’s US election win has turned the fortune for one of Europe’s biggest hedge funds.  Brevan Howard has a team of more than 1,000 people including more than 160 portfolio managers. The firm has offices across Europe, Asia and North America.  Brevan Howard’s Abu Dhabi office, which was opened in February 2023, is becoming one of the most important locations for the hedge fund. The firm has more than 100 employees in its Abu Dhabi office managing more than $10bn in assets.  Abu Dhabi is also home to Brevan Howard co-founder Trifon Natsis, who moved to the UAE’s capital last year.  Brevan Howard is hiring across its London, Singapore and Jersey offices. The hedge fund is searching for top quantitative analysts for its London office, according to LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=4073476775&f_C=17873&geoId=92000000&origin=COMPANY_PAGE_JOBS_CLUSTER_EXPANSION&originToLandingJobPostings=4073476775%2C4080556864%2C4086237438%2C4065962471%2C4079491390> .

The fund returned about 31% this year through October, the person said. The Bloomberg US Corporate High Yield Bond Index returned 7.42% in the same period and a separate index of credit rated CCC, which is eight notches into junk territory and equivalent to the ratings of both countries’ debt, returned 13.39%.  Aurelius’ first drawdown fund has earned almost 33% this year through October and 154% since its 2022 inception, according to the person, who asked not to be named discussing private information. A spokesperson for Aurelius declined to comment. The returns come under the tenure of its chief investment officer, Eleanor Chan, an Aurelius veteran and the wife of its founder, Mark Brodsky, as of 2018. Chan joined the firm as an analyst in 2005, a year after graduating from Yale, and rose through the ranks to managing director. She became co-CIO in 2022 and sole CIO in 2023.   The sum of assets under management by Aurelius has shrunk since 2018 to about $1 billion from closer to $2.4 billion, as the firm shifted from its longstanding flexible fund structure to a drawdown model.      Argentina Battle   Aurelius was one of a group of funds that by 2010 had bought up large chunks of debt Argentina defaulted on in 2001 during an economic crisis. It helped lead a years-long battle during which group members pursued litigation and other measures to pressure the government into repaying them. The bet worked, as estimates put Aurelius’ returns from that situation at about 700% as of 2018, Bloomberg previously reported.  Read More: Hated by Many, Distressed Debt Brawler Isn’t About to Back Down Argentina’s enduring economic struggles, as well as political discontent and post-pandemic inflation, helped push the country to elect right-wing populist Javier Milei in 2023. Recently, its sovereign bonds have gained on Milei’s promise of “shock therapy” for the country’s economy. Aurelius’s Argentina holdings largely date back to the 2016 settlement that saw the nation issue $15 billion in debt to repay creditors, according to one of the people familiar.  Ukraine, for its part, was plunged into chaos after Russia’s 2022 invasion. Aurelius was part of a group of hedge funds holding its defaulted debt that recently hashed out a plan for Ukraine to start paying its bondholders, even as the war rages on.  The firm also notched profits in 2022 through investments in Russian companies’ debt.   Other investments driving Aurelius’ fund gains this year included the formerly bankrupt Bitcoin miner Core Scientific Inc. and peers, which have pivoted to developing high-powered computing centers, and Indian miner Vedanta Ltd.   --With assistance from Katherine Burton and Gowri Gurumurthy.

As 2024 concludes, these funds hold unprecedented volumes of long positions in European gas futures, and while such bets have benefited from volatile conditions, concerns are mounting that their concentration could exacerbate instability.  With market liquidity thinning as year-end approaches, the sheer size of hedge fund wagers looms large. Traders warn that a sudden shift — such as profit-taking or changing fundamentals — could lead to a rapid selloff, intensifying volatility in an already fragile market.  The report quotes Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, Chief Analyst at Global Risk Management, as saying that: “The heavy concentration of positions stresses the market, pushing it to a limit that will eventually break. And it becomes a real risk when everyone wants to get out at the same time.”  Unlike traditional power companies, hedge funds do not buy gas for consumers or sell production from physical assets, making their trades more speculative and less tied to operational needs, which can amplify volatility and cause abrupt price movements.  Hedge funds have reaped massive profits from Europe’s energy volatility, with Millennium earning about $600m from commodities trading in 2023, while Citadel’s commodities division brought in $4bn. Despite these gains, hedge funds’ speculative positioning could backfire if market conditions shift.  Concerns over colder winter forecasts, depleting gas inventories, and delayed liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects have fuelled a bullish outlook for gas prices, but optimism is tempered by factors such as stronger LNG flows and the potential continuation of Russian gas through Ukraine despite the expiry of a transit deal.  If geopolitical risks subside, prices could plummet as risk premiums evaporate. “For now, the market is quite bullish,” said George Cultraro, global head of commodities at Bank of America. “But the most pain is not to the upside. It’s definitely to the downside because of that same positioning, and I don’t think anybody is quite ready to give up on the bull story just yet.”   View article... <https://www.hedgeweek.com/big-hedge-fund-bets-on-european-gas-prices-could-spark-market-turmoil/>      The information contained in this email and its attachments are confidential and may be legally privileged.

Traders warn that a sudden shift — such as profit-taking or changing fundamentals — could lead to a rapid selloff, intensifying volatility in an already fragile market.  The report quotes Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, Chief Analyst at Global Risk Management, as saying that: “The heavy concentration of positions stresses the market, pushing it to a limit that will eventually break. And it becomes a real risk when everyone wants to get out at the same time.”  Unlike traditional power companies, hedge funds do not buy gas for consumers or sell production from physical assets, making their trades more speculative and less tied to operational needs, which can amplify volatility and cause abrupt price movements.  Hedge funds have reaped massive profits from Europe’s energy volatility, with Millennium earning about $600m from commodities trading in 2023, while Citadel’s commodities division brought in $4bn. Despite these gains, hedge funds’ speculative positioning could backfire if market conditions shift.  Concerns over colder winter forecasts, depleting gas inventories, and delayed liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects have fuelled a bullish outlook for gas prices, but optimism is tempered by factors such as stronger LNG flows and the potential continuation of Russian gas through Ukraine despite the expiry of a transit deal.  If geopolitical risks subside, prices could plummet as risk premiums evaporate. “For now, the market is quite bullish,” said George Cultraro, global head of commodities at Bank of America. “But the most pain is not to the upside. It’s definitely to the downside because of that same positioning, and I don’t think anybody is quite ready to give up on the bull story just yet.”   View article... <https://www.hedgeweek.com/big-hedge-fund-bets-on-european-gas-prices-could-spark-market-turmoil/>       The information contained in this email and its attachments are confidential and may be legally privileged.

Dean is no longer planning to take Capula Tactical Macro fund to his newly established West Basin Capital Management, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Dean, who planned to make the move by January 2025, will instead return to manage money for Capula, the people said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. The homecoming follows Dean’s strategy losing about 2.2% through September this year, the people said, adding the change in plans has resulted in the departure of some staff hired in anticipation of the launch. Capula’s other Multistrategy Hedge Fund was up 4.4%, while its flagship Relative Value fund gained 5.6% through November. A representative for London-based Capula and Dean declined to comment. Dean’s retreat shows challenges faced by even seasoned money managers who seek to leave well-established hedge funds to strike out on their own. While there have been successes such as Millennium Management’s senior trader Diego Megia and former Moore Capital Management’s Joeri Jacobs, starting a hedge fund and raising external capital remain tough.  A total of 123 hedge fund firms set up shop this year through September, the least for new entrants since at least 2000 annually, according to data compiled by Preqin. Capula, which oversees about $30 billion in assets, was supportive of Dean’s move and expected to retain a commercial interest in his business, Bloomberg News had reported previously. Dean, who studied Mathematics at Yale University, joined Capula in 2017. He specializes in G-10 rates, currency and equity options trading. Previously, he worked at Element Capital Management. His Capula Tactical fund focuses on developed-markets macro strategy with a rates trading bias. It gained 3.4% in 2023 and 17.7% the year before, according to an investor document seen by Bloomberg News.

One of Arini's most recent hires is Elliott Nagelmackers, a former associate in Credit Suisse's investment bank. He had transitioned to UBS, but ultimately decided Arini was the better gig.     Arini's early joiners received some large pay packages. Last year it paid a total of $87.2m in 'salaries and wages' according to accounts filed with Companies House. This is thought to include guaranteed bonuses for employees still on gardening leave. If Arini had 67 employees, including those in the pipeline, this would mean it paid $1.3m on average.

Rob Citrone’s Discovery Capital Management, which manages about $2.5 billion and focuses on macro bets in emerging markets, jumped 52% last year, according to a person familiar with the matter. Zach Schreiber’s PointState Capital rose 47.9%, another person said, asking not to be named as the details aren’t public. “For the first three to six months of 2025, it is going to be all about ‘America First’ asset performance,” Marko Papic, chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research, which counts many macro hedge funds as clients, wrote in his outlook for this year. The dollar has jumped against every major currency since the election, and is now close to par with the euro. US stocks, while they’ve given back some of their post-vote gains, are also higher than they were on Nov. 5. Macro funds have been emerging from a tough spell, battered by more than a decade of rock-bottom interest rates that curbed their money-making opportunities. Some funds continued to lose out in 2023 even as elevated rates helped others turn their performance around.  Last year brought better luck for many of these managers, who can wager on stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. These strategies are now posting some the best returns in the hedge fund industry.  D.E. Shaw’s Oculus, the firm’s second-biggest fund that mostly makes macro wagers, soared 36%.  The Trump trade — long stocks and the dollar, short bonds — was a boon for some funds through the election. London-based Chris Rokos made $1 billion soon after it became clear that Trump would win, and his Rokos Capital Management was up 28.5% through late November.  Other macro funds missed out on the opportunities toward the end of last year. Bridgewater Associates’s Pure Alpha fund, which had been up almost 16% in the first quarter, ended the year up 11.3%.

The downturn was driven by lower turnover, which slid to £769m from £1.2bn the previous year, with the performance of Marshall Wace’s two flagship funds, Eureka and TOPS, significantly underperforming their benchmarks during the period, contributing to the poor financial results.  In the 2023 financial year, the Eureka fund delivered a modest 4.6% return, while TOPS rose by 7.7%. These figures fell short of the double-digit returns typically expected from top-performing hedge funds. As a result, the firm’s performance fees plunged by 75%, from nearly £600m to £163m, according to the accounts.

The downturn was driven by lower turnover, which slid to £769m from £1.2bn the previous year, with the performance of Marshall Wace’s two flagship funds, Eureka and TOPS, significantly underperforming their benchmarks during the period, contributing to the poor financial results.  In the 2023 financial year, the Eureka fund delivered a modest 4.6% return, while TOPS rose by 7.7%. These figures fell short of the double-digit returns typically expected from top-performing hedge funds. As a result, the firm’s performance fees plunged by 75%, from nearly £600m to £163m, according to the accounts.

Brevan Howard’s crypto fund rose 33% in November and 51% for the year, while Galaxy’s strategy surged 43% and 90%, respectively. Galaxy also doubled its assets under management to $4.8bn, partly by acquiring assets from bankrupt crypto firms.  Bitcoin’s 130% rise this year to around $100,000 added $1.8tn to the market value of crypto tokens, now totalling $3.5tn, per the FT Wiltshire Digital Assets Dashboard. This rally, driven by Donald Trump’s election victory, renewed optimism for a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment compared to the Biden administration’s cautious stance.  The crypto market’s rebound marks a dramatic turnaround from the 2022 downturn, when the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange pushed bitcoin to $15,500. Galaxy Digital, for instance, reported a $1bn loss during that crisis.  Momentum returned in January 2024 when the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 bitcoin exchange-traded funds, opening new investment opportunities. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has since endorsed bitcoin’s inclusion in multi-asset portfolios.  NextGen Digital Venture, a $120m crypto equity fund, gained 330% since its March 2023 launch, benefiting from investments in bitcoin ETFs, Coinbase, and MicroStrategy, which rose 60% and 400%, respectively.  Macro hedge funds also increased exposure to digital assets. MP Alpha Capital’s $20m global macro fund gained over 30% this year, driven by investments in bitcoin, ether, and bitcoin miners.

Shah (Bloomberg) -- CastleKnight Management, a credit and equity hedge fund founded by Appaloosa Management alum Aaron Weitman, gained a net 27% in its master vehicle, according to people with knowledge of the returns. The roughly $1.75 billion fund profited from healthcare and technology bets — especially businesses benefiting from the boom in artificial intelligence — said the people, who asked not to be named discussing the private results. It’s up 205% net of fees since launching in October 2020, they added.  Top contributors in 2024 included investments in Rackspace Technology Inc., Radiology Partners Inc. and Vertiv Holdings Co., the people said. CastleKnight during the year also bought shares of Celestica Inc., an electronic-equipment manufacturer whose US-listed stock surged 215%.  A spokesperson at CastleKnight, whose portfolio is slightly more than half in credit, declined to comment. The master vehicle’s returns bested the S&P 500 and the PivotalPath Event Driven Index, a hedge-fund benchmark. They respectively rose 23% and 9.9% last year.  Rackspace, a cloud computing firm, struck a deal in early 2024 to obtain new capital and reduce debt through a below-par exchange that reworked the line for creditor repayments. It was an early example of “friendlier” liability-management deals that allowed all secured creditors to participate, albeit at different terms.  CastleKnight is targeting other companies — especially in the industrial and material sectors — that have recently undergone such liability management and could see operating results improve, the people said. A revival of takeover activity, especially among small- and mid-cap companies, could also present opportunities, they added.   To contact the reporter on this story: Jill R.
